   Calculating Transport Distribution function (TDF) and DOS...
     k-grid used for band interpolation in BoltzWann: 50x50x50
     Number of electrons per state: 1
     Relaxation time (fs):    10.00000000    
   TDF and DOS calculated.

 > WARNING! There are 41 (mu,T) pairs for which the electrical
