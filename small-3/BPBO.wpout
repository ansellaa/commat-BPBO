     k-grid used for band interpolation in BoltzWann: 50x50x50
     Number of electrons per state: 1
     Relaxation time (fs):    10.00000000    
   TDF and DOS calculated.

 > WARNING! There are 41 (mu,T) pairs for which the electrical
 >          conductivity has zero determinant.
 >          Seebeck coefficient set to zero for those pairs.
 >          Check if this is physical or not.
 >          (If you are dealing with a 2D system, set the boltz_2d_dir flag.)
